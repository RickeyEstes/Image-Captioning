# Image Captioning
This project was created as part of a submission for Computer Vision, Nanodegree  via [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891). 

## Project Overview
In this work we combine Deep Convolutional Nets for image classification  with Recurrent Networks for sequence modeling, to create a single network that generates descriptions of image using [COCO Dataset - Common Objects in Context](http://cocodataset.org/). 

[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) described the implementation of the RNN Decoder.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

__Notebook 0__ : 0_Dataset.ipynb

__Notebook 1__ : 1_Preliminaries.ipynb

__Notebook 2__ : 2_Training.ipynb

__Notebook 3__ : 3_Inference.ipynb
