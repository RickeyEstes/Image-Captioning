# Image-Captioning
Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This project was created as part of a submission for Computer Vision, Nanodegree  via [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891). For this project I have to design a CNN-RNN model for automatically generating image captions using [COCO Dataset](http://cocodataset.org/).

## Project Structure
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

__Notebook 0__ : 0_Dataset.ipynb

__Notebook 1__ : 1_Preliminaries.ipynb

__Notebook 2__ : 2_Training.ipynb

__Notebook 3__ : 3_Inference.ipynb
