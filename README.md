# Image-Captioning
Computer Vision

Create a Deep Neural Network Architecture to automatically generate captions from images.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

__Notebook 1__ : 0_Dataset.ipynb

__Notebook 2__ : 1_Preliminaries.ipynb

__Notebook 3__ : 2_Training.ipynb

__Notebook 4__ : 3_Inference.ipynb
